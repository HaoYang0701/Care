Create and initialize PeerConnectionFactory
Create a VideoCapturer instance which uses the camera of the device
Create a VideoSource from the Capturer
Create a VideoTrack from the source
Create a video renderer using a SurfaceViewRenderer view and add it to the VideoTrack instance

NATs block the UDP/TCP audio/video streams. This is why we need a STUN server to expose the public ip

Ran through quick twilio tut to implement their SDK
Implemented SDK
Figured out the API keys, account sid, secret key and how to get access tokens (this might need to go on the server in the future)

Seems like we need a java backend server to actually give us the auth token. the library does not work with android.
